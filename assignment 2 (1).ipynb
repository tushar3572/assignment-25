    "You can prevent overfitting by diversifying and scaling your training data set or using some other data science strategies, like those given below.\n",
    "Early stopping:\n",
    "Early stopping pauses the training phase before the machine learning model learns the noise in the data. However, getting the timing right is important; else the model will still not give accurate results.\n",
    "Pruning:\n",
    "You might identify several features or parameters that impact the final prediction when you build a model. Feature selection—or pruning—identifies the most important features within the training set and eliminates irrelevant ones. For example, to predict if an image is an animal or human, you can look at various input parameters like face shape, ear position, body structure, etc. You may prioritize face shape and ignore the shape of the eyes.\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "Regularization is a collection of training/optimization techniques that seek to reduce overfitting. These methods try to eliminate those factors that do not impact the prediction outcomes by grading features based on importance. For example, mathematical calculations apply a penalty value to features with minimal impact. Consider a statistical model attempting to predict the housing prices of a city in 20 years. Regularization would give a lower penalty value to features like population growth and average annual income but a higher penalty value to the average annual temperature of the city.\n",
    "Ensembling:\n",
    "Ensembling combines predictions from several separate machine learning algorithms. Some models are called weak learners because their results are often inaccurate. Ensemble methods combine all the weak learners to get more accurate results. They use multiple models to analyze sample data and pick the most accurate outcomes. The two main ensemble methods are bagging and boosting. Boosting trains different machine learning models one after another to get the final result, while bagging trains them in parallel.\n",
    "Data augmentation:\n",
    "Data augmentation is a machine learning technique that changes the sample data slightly every time the model processes it. You can do this by changing the input data in small ways. When done in moderation, data augmentation makes the training sets appear unique to the model and prevents the model from learning their characteristics. For example, applying transformations such as translation, flipping, and rotation to input images.    "

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that relates to the performance of predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A high bias means the model makes strong assumptions about the underlying data, leading to systematic errors. For instance, if we fit a linear regression model to data that is inherently nonlinear, the model will have high bias because it cannot capture the complexity of the underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance, on the other hand, refers to the amount by which the model's predictions would change if we estimated it using a different training dataset. A high variance indicates that the model is very sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data and captures noise along with the underlying signal. Overly complex models tend to have high variance because they can fit the training data too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between bias and variance is inversely proportional. Increasing the bias of a model typically reduces its variance and vice versa. This is the essence of the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how these factors affect model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Bias, Low Variance: Models with high bias tend to oversimplify the underlying patterns in the data. They may consistently underpredict or overpredict the target variable. Such models perform poorly both on the training data and unseen data because they fail to capture the complexity of the underlying relationship. This situation is known as underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Bias, High Variance: Models with low bias and high variance can capture complex patterns in the data but are sensitive to noise. They may perform very well on the training data but generalize poorly to unseen data because they fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying signal. This situation is known as overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced Bias-Variance: The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance. A model that achieves a good balance between bias and variance will generalize well to unseen data. This typically involves selecting a model with sufficient complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data but not so complex that it fits the noise.    "

    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's cost function. The penalty discourages overly complex models by penalizing large parameter values. This helps in achieving a balance between fitting the training data well and generalizing to unseen data.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",

    "L2 regularization adds the squared values of the model's coefficients as a penalty term to the cost function.\n",
    "The regularization term is proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients.\n",

    "It is effective in reducing the impact of outliers and multicollinearity in the data.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization:\n",

    "Elastic Net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding both the absolute and squared values of the coefficients to the cost function.\n",
    "It includes two hyperparameters, alpha and l1_ratio, which control the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.\n",

    "Dropout:\n",

    "Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks.\n",
    "During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the units in a layer to zero, effectively disabling them.\n",
